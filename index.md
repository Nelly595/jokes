## My first story 

Once upon a time a man decided to make a website but was a bit stuck and needed help. ![](uploads/pic 1.jpg) 


 ```html 
<script src="https://utteranc.es/client.js"
        repo="your-github-username/your-github-repo" 
        issue-term="pathname"
        theme="github-dark"
        label="comment"
        crossorigin="anonymous"
        async>
</script> 
```
